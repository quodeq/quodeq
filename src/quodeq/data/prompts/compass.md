## Your Task

Analyse the codebase for the **{{DIMENSION}}** quality dimension. Use the tools available to you (Bash, Glob, Grep, Read) to explore the code systematically. Report each finding using the `report_finding` tool as you discover it.

## Reporting Findings

For EVERY finding (violation or compliance), call `report_finding` with:

- `req` — the **bold requirement ID** from the checklist (e.g. `M-MOD-1`, `S-CON-3`). The server auto-fills principle name and dimension from this.
- `t` — `violation` or `compliance`
- `file` — file path relative to repo root
- `line` — line number
- `snippet` — the relevant code (under 200 chars)
- `severity` — `critical`, `major`, or `minor`
- `w` — short description of what you found

**Optional:** `reason` — why this is a violation or compliance

## Severity Definitions

- **critical** — Security vulnerability, data loss risk, or crash in production path
- **major** — Significant quality issue that should be fixed (wrong pattern, missing guard, bad practice)
- **minor** — Style issue, minor inefficiency, or improvement opportunity

## Search Strategy

1. **Grep first** — Use Grep to find patterns relevant to the requirements in the standards checklist
2. **Read to confirm** — Read the surrounding code to verify the finding is real (not in tests, comments, or dead code)
3. **Report immediately** — Call `report_finding` as soon as you confirm a finding

## CRITICAL: Report Findings Immediately

Call `report_finding` immediately after confirming each finding. Do NOT batch findings — the system tracks them in real time.

Pattern: Grep → Read to confirm → `report_finding` → next pattern.

If `report_finding` says "Duplicate", move on — the finding is already captured.

## Project Size Adaptation

Adapt your analysis depth to the project size:

| Source files | Max files to read |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 1-20        | All               |
| 21-100      | 30                |
| 101-500     | 50                |
| 500+        | 70                |

## Systematic Evaluation

Evaluate every file you read against every applicable principle in the standards checklist.

For each file:
1. Identify which principles from the checklist apply to this file
2. For each applicable principle — does this file violate or comply? Report it.
3. If a principle is not applicable to this file, skip it.

**Ground rules:**
- Report ALL violations and ALL compliance you observe — do not bias toward either
- Do not fabricate or inflate findings to reach any quota. If you found 5 real findings, report 5.
- Every finding must be backed by a specific code location (file, line, snippet)
- For every principle where you find violations, actively look for files that follow the principle correctly
- For every principle where code is compliant, verify there are no violations elsewhere

## What to Analyze

Focus on the project's **own source code** — skip generated, vendored, compiled, and dependency directories. Use the project type above to decide what matters: a backend API has different quality concerns than a mobile app or a CLI tool.

## Standards Checklist

The checklist is organized by ISO 25010 sub-characteristic (`###` headings) with numbered requirements (**bold IDs**). Use the **bold ID** as the `req` field (e.g. `M-MOD-1`, `S-CON-3`).
